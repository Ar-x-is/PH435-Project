# A Symphony of Fractals: Window to the Infinite
This project demonstrates the fascinating world of fractals, chaos, and nonlinear dynamics through interactive simulations. Developed as part of the PH435 Microprocessors course offered at IIT Bombay, it leverages the Arduino UNO and a TFT LCD to visualize fractals, chaotic systems, and more.

## Project Features

### 1. Mandelbrot and Julia Sets Visualization:
- Generates and displays the iconic Mandelbrot set.
- Allows users to select specific points on the Mandelbrot set to generate corresponding Julia sets.
- Uses color maps to enhance visual clarity of convergence and divergence.

### 2. Lorenz Attractor Simulation:
- Simulates chaotic dynamics of the Lorenz system.
- Visualizes the sensitivity to initial conditions through the iconic "butterfly" shape.
- Displays evolving trajectories with dynamic color gradients.

### 3. Chaos Game and Sierpinski Triangle:
- Demonstrates fractal construction using the Chaos Game algorithm.
- Animates the iterative generation of the Sierpinski Triangle.

### 4. Interactive Touchscreen Menu:
- Provides an intuitive touchscreen interface for simulation selection.
- Allows seamless switching between simulations.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino UNO: Acts as the computational core for fractal generation and dynamic simulation.
- TFT LCD with Touchscreen: 3.5‚Äù display with 480x320 resolution used for visualization and user interaction.
